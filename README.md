## 📌 Overview

A machine learning–based system that classifies URLs as **Phishing** or **Legitimate** using lexical and statistical features extracted from URLs.
The model is trained using a **Random Forest classifier** and achieves **90%+ accuracy** on test data.

This project is designed to be **beginner-friendly** while following **industry-level ML deployment practices**, making it suitable for internships and portfolio showcase.
